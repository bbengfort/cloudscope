# CloudScope

**Visualization of distributed systems and communications.**

## Basic Plan

Right now the plan is to have the `cloudscope` package generate a static site, which will then be placed into the `gh-pages` repository for hosting. A simple static web server can serve that site for development. Generation of the static site, in this case, is simply the generation of JSON data from graphs that are constructed by the `cloudscope` utility.

## About

Simple repository to visualize examples of data flow in distributed systems. Inspired by [The Secret Lives of Data](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) and [RaftScope](https://github.com/ongardie/raftscope).
