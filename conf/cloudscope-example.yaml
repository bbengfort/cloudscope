    # Workload Parameters
    users: 1                  # number of simulated users creating traces
    max_objects_accessed: 1   # maximum number of objects that can be accessed
    synchronous_access: false # each access has to wait on the previous access to be triggered
    valid_locations:          # locations to allow user to move to.
        - home
        - work
        - mobile

    invalid_types:      # replica types that shouldn't have accesses.
        - storage

    move_prob: 0.2      # probability of moving locations
    switch_prob: 0.4    # probability of switching devices
    object_prob: 0.3    # probability of switching the currently accessed object
    access_mean: 1800   # mean delay (milliseconds) between accesses
    access_stddev: 512  # standard deviation of delay (milliseconds) between accesses
    read_prob: 0.8      # probability of read access; write probability is 1 - read_prob

    # Eventual Parameters
    anti_entropy_delay: 3000        # delay in milliseconds (20x per minute)
    do_gossip: true                 # perform gossip protocol
    do_rumoring: true               # perform rumor mongering

    # Raft Parameters
    election_timeout: [150, 300]    # Range to randomly select the election timeout
    heartbeat_interval: 75          # Usually half the minimum election timeout
    aggregate_writes: False         # Don't send writes until heartbeat.

    # Tag Parameters
